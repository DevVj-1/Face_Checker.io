# FUTURE PLANES & UPDATES
#### I have limited time to submit this project, but I plan to add more features in future updates. For instance, I will soon include the ability to predict the age of a person in an image. Additionally, users will be able to upload CCTV footage and multiple images of the same person from different angles. This tool will then detect the presence of the person in the CCTV footage and record the time frames in which the person is detected. This feature could significantly help  police officers  by saving them the time required to manually watch and investigate CCTV footage. They can simply run this tool in the background.
